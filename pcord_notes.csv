4,1000005,At 7.0 cm there is a knot which appears to unite two khipu
5,1000008,The beginning knot joins this khipu to UR12 and UR15. The knot around 22.5 joins it with UR14.
6,1000009,This khipu is attached to 257E/UR14 and to 257D/UR13
7,1000015,"The primary cord is actually broken into two pieces.  The ""marker"" at 12.0 cm is actually a break between separate pieces of the quipu which were not necessarily connected at that point."
8,1000016,The main cord is finished with a thread wrapping that extends for 1.0 cm.
9,1000020,"1. (Beginning:) $ Nudo de comienzo (cordon doblado) 2.  Break at M1.  Several cords have been sewn onto the panel at break.  I have omitted these cords although their color, etc., is similar to other on this khipu (-GU, rec. by AA)"

12,1000029,AS207B and AS207C are attached to the primary cord in the gap of 40.5-43.5 cm (as indicated by the knots).
13,1000032,Construction note: The end of the main cord has been cut or cut and wrapped.  This finishing may be intentional and the quipu complete.  At 19.5 cm the main cord has been repaired or joined to another piece of the same cord.
14,1000034,1.  Two cords of 30 cm and 19 cm are knotted together and knotted to the main cord within the 9.5 cm space between pendants 61 and 62.  Both cords appear to have been cut.  The cords are undyed (W) but have marks of being unravelled from some mottled combination.  The cord attachments do not appear to be part of the original khipu construction and there is nowhere on the khipu they seem to come from.  2. Three cords of color MB are wrapped around the end knot giving the effect of a six strand fringe.  The strands of the fringe are 3.0 - 6.0 cm long.  The cords appear to have been cut after being attached.
15,1000036,Cords 1 and 2 are linked through the twisted end of the main cord so that they dangle from the end of the main cord.
16,1000037,These fragments were not attached to any primary cord.
17,1000040,"The main cord begins with a woven cord ball.  The ball is DB, 1.0 cm thick, and 1.5 cm long.  The main cord is S-spun, Z-plyed, S-plyed.  Double cords."
18,1000043,The twisted ends of the main cords of the 2 parts are tied together with a square knot.
19,1000044,The twisted ends of the main cords of the 2 parts are tied together in a square knot.
20,1000045,See notes for construction of primary cord within wooden bar.
21,1000047,"The beginning is twisted, as normal, but then the end of the main cord has been formed into a loop by bending it back on itself and binding it in place.  Two pendants (1-2) are suspended from the end loop.  See Ascher and Ascher 1987:710 for drawing."
22,1000048,"Main cord consists of ""Br:W S-plyed yarns which are Z-wrapped by Br:W yarns"""
23,1000050,AS107 is loosely tied around the wooden bar through which AS106 is threaded.
24,1000051,"This khipu is threaded through a wooden bar (see diagram, Ascher and Ascher 1987:721).  The ""groups"" represent pendants clustered on loops of the main cord between two holes in the wood."
25,1000056,"This quipu is threaded through a wooden bar.  (The pendants appear to be listed in order along the cord, with the possible exception of P7-13, because the cord loops through a hole.)"
26,1000062,The main cord is finished with a cotton bulb that is 2.0 cm in cross-section.
27,1000064,"Another pendant, just after pendant 5, was probably present as indicated by the discoloration on the main cord."
28,1000065,There are no knots on the pendant cords.
29,1000071,"Main cord positions were extrapolated for all groups, as only initial positions of ""group/top cord/group/space"" clusters were recorded."
30,1000074,"The main cord is braided D0:W, S-wrapped with D0.  The second group (pendants 2-8) are noted by G. Urton as ""This group is actually on a ""subsidiary"" main cord (see p. 793)."""
31,1000080,"This khipu is threaded through a wooden bar.  See diagram in Ascher and Ascher 1987:815.  According to the diagram, the correct pendant order (from twisted beginning to broken ending) is ... P23-28, P29-34, P12-17, P1-5, P6-11, P18-22, and a 1s knot.  (Order may be reversed within those groupings.)  "
32,1000081,This khipu is attached to AS124.  It is looped and tied into the main cord after all the pendant (and knot) before the broken end.
33,1000083,Main cord is Z-plyed and then S-wrapped with a white cord.
34,1000088,"The khipu terminates in a fringed woven ball (drawing pg 850 of Ascher and Ascher 1987).  There are 5 ribs on the ball each approx 0.3 cm wide and separated from the next rib by 0.5 cm.  Thus, the ball measures about 4.0 cm around and is 1.25 cm at its widest."
35,1000089,The main cord is made up of 3 cords.
36,1000094,Attached to wooden bar
37,1000095,"The beginning is both knotted and twisted.  Pendant cords 49-54  are listed as starting at 15.0 cm, followed by a space of 7.0 cm, however pendants 55-62 start at 16.5 cm.  "
38,1000096,About 20.0 cm of the main cord is tied in one large knot.
39,1000099,"Primary cord appears to have previously been cord-wrapped (s-wrapping); however, the cord-wrapping has been removed (leaving its impression and some discoloration).  Removing the cord-wrapping would have necessitated removing pendant strings and reattaching them later."
40,1000100,"Khipu 32.30.30/53 is composed of two khipus tied together (A & B).  Pendants 24 and 25 appear to be a single string, looped through the end of khipu A."

46,1000107,thickness is about 0.2 cm
47,1000110,"Main cord of Khipu AS033F now passes through plies of main cord of khipu AS033G.  At this end, primary cord of AS033G passes through plies of AS033F.  Cords 1-2 are attached to the primary cord in a complicated manner that is diagrammed in Ascher and Ascher 1987:166-167 with additional notes from CJB 11/01/2002."
48,1000111,"The main cord was passed through its twisted end to form a loop of 1.0 cm (pendants 1-3 are on this loop), see diagram in Ascher and Ascher 1987:897."
49,1000114,"Pendants are actually attached to cord running through the bar; cord is brown, Z-spun, S-plied."
50,1000116,The main cord is finished by being bent back and inserted through its own strands.
51,1000117,Main cord is Z-plyed BB:W which is S-wrapped with BB cord.
52,1000118,"Primary cord: brown and white cords are first braided and then the braid is wrapped with a white string (S-wrapped), see photo"

57,1000133,The main cord of the quipu is formed into a large loop by having its knotted end passed through its twisted end.  This loop occurs 2.0 cm after the group of pendants (leaving 7.0 cm after the loop).
58,1000134,The B main cord (AS162A) is extended by a W main cord (AS162B).  The W main cord is formed into a large loop by being passed through its own twisted end.  It has also been passed through the twisted end of the B main cord so that it dangles from the end of the B cord.  (See diagram in Ascher and Ascher 1987:1001.)
59,1000135,The B main cord (AS162A) is extended by a W main cord (AS162B).  The W main cord is formed into a large loop by being passed through its own twisted end.

73,1000237,Beginning and end of primary cord are knotted together so that primary cord forms a loop.
74,1000238,"Primary cord has complex color patterning typical of Puruchuco khipu.  The final cord has three components: KB, W, and W-AB.  These three are plied together.  Before final plying, primary cord has two components: one of KB interlocked with W at the doubling point, one of AB interlocked with W at the doubling point.  The presumption is that the W and AB cord was doubled and plied Z, then the KB W cord was doubled and all three were plied together S.  For sketch, see original notes.  Color shorthand KB-W-(W-AB).

105,1000273,"10- In general, the subsidiaries of pendants on khipu UR35 are oriented so that those on adjacent pendants go in opposite directions. This should/may form paired sets of pendants. However, this feature seems to be more common on the first half of the khipu than the second half.   11- The symbol BL marks what is for this author a new knot type. I am calling it herein the ""belted long knot"". There seem to be three belted long knots on khipu UR35 (pendants 83, 84 and  84s4s1). All of these examples are on odd-numbered knots. The ""belt"" of the belted long knots is formed by carrying one turn of an odd-numbered long knot over the axis.  Note: of the three examples of belted long knots on khipu UR35, two have the belt marking the central turn of the odd numbered knot (i.e. the 5th of a knot of 9 turns). In one case (84s4s1), the belt marks the 4th/6th turn of a knot of 9 turns. "
