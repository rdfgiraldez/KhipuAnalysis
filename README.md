# KhipuAnalysis
Exploratory Data Analysis of khipus from the Aschers' "Code of the Quipu: Databook", Pereyra's book "Quipus del Museo del Sitio Pachacamac" and Harvard's Khipu Database. 

The folder KhipuDB_SQL was downloaded from khipukamayuq.fas.harvard.eduFeb 4,2021. As the site is no longer active and the database is not posted elsewhere online, I share it here. If the owner of the database requests it to be taken down, I will. KhipuDB_SQL contains multiple files in MySQL format.

collca.db is a SQLite database created from KhipuDB_SQL, along with added information from Marcia and Robert Ascher's article "Numbers and Relations from Ancient Andean Quipus", which contains observations AS1-AS9. I have also corrected entries using published sources, such as the Aschers' "Code of the Quipu: Databook", Pereyra's book "Quipus del Museo del Sitio Pachacamac". As I am actively studying the khipus, I will continue to update collca.db as I come across discrepancies.

Python scripts were developed in Jupyter Notebooks.
